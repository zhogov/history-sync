# An Oh My Zsh plugin for GPG encrypted, Internet synchronized Zsh history using Git  

That is, if you'd like an easy way to securely synchronise your zsh_history across many computers connected to the Internet, this plugin will help you. **Be creative with this - I dare you.**

## What tooling do I need?
1. GnuPG  
history-sync uses GPG to encrypt/decrypt your zsh_history. The [GnuPG documentation](https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals.html) is very good.

2. Git  
history-sync uses Git to push/pull your zsh_history to/from a remote repository.  

## How do I  use it?
1. Create a Git repo for housing your encrypted zsh_history file. This repo needs to be accessible from all client shells you'd like to synchronize
   - Mine is *$HOME/.zsh_history_proj*
2. Activate history-sync plugin in your *.zshrc*
   - `git clone git@github.com:wulfgarpro/history-sync.git $HOME/.oh-my-zsh/plugins/.`
3. Export environment variables (or use defaults found in the plugin file history-sync.plugin.zsh)  
   These are:
   - **ZSH_HISTORY_FILE**  
   Your zsh_history file location
   - **ZSH_HISTORY_PROJ**  
   Your Git project for housing your zsh_history file
   - **ZSH_HISTORY_FILE_ENC**  
   Your encrypted zsh_history file location
   - **GIT_COMMIT_MSG**  
   Your default message when pushing to *$ZSH_HISTORY_PROJ*
4. Ensure your GPG setup is complete and you have a public/private key pair for encrypting/decrypting: `man gpg`
5. Run `zhpl` to pull
6. Run `zhps` to encrypt and push
7. Run `zhsync` to pull/push
